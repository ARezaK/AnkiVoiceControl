To get started open this up on Xcode using the workspace file
make sure when you build you build it on your device
the main source file is in 
src/compononents/ankiWebView.js
Bundle Identifier: org.voice.demo.anki.www
Display Name: AnkiVoice
React native version: v0.48.4 (I think)

1) npm install -g create-react-native-app
x) cd to Anki folder and run 'npm install'
2) Select AgC iphone in xcode
4) under build settings set to iOS version that you have
3) Click run

gotta figure out what differences there are between mo's laptop and mine. check in xcode settings and versions of packages such as react-native
